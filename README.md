# WeatherApp
I created a weather app on Android Studio. The way that this would work is that I first integrate the openweather api, which takes in a zip code. Then, I parse the data into a JSON format, and display the maximum and minimum temperature, along with any severe weather events such as rain, snow, thunderstorms, and so on. Additionally, I also show the forecast for the upcoming days, and displayed the same information as with the current data. The final component of this is that I added my own theme to it with the weather statements and pictures, which in this case is superheroes and comics.
